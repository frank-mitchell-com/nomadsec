Programs to generate sector data for _Faster Than Light: Nomad_.
As of this writing, the format is somewhat idiosyncratic.
Conversion to <https://travellermap.com/make/poster> formats are for the
future.

TODO
- Get "grammar" of name generator from file.
- Alternatively, take names from a list.
- Generate other _Nomad_ stuff?
